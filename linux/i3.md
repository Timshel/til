Source : https://feeblenerd.blogspot.com/2015/11/pretty-i3-with-xfce.html

Packages needed to build locally :

```bash
apt install libxfce4panel-2.0-dev libxfce4ui-2-dev xfce4-dev-tools libjson-glib-dev libjson-glib gobject-introspection libglib2.0-dev-bin gtk-doc-tools glib xcb-proto libxcb-dev

## Some manual steps :

### Deactivate Xubuntu's window manager

Open 'Session and Startup', and go to the 'Session' tab.
Note xfwm4 and xfdesktop. These processes will be replaced by the i3 Window Manager.
For xfwm4, click 'Immediately' and change it to the  'Never' option.
For xfdesktop, click 'Immediately' and change it to the 'Never' option.
Click the button: 'Save Session'.
Go to the 'Application Autostart' tab to activate the i3 window manager in the next stage.

### Activate the i3 window manager

In the 'Session and Startup' window, make sure you are in the 'Application Autostart' tab.
Click the button 'Add' to add i3 to the list of startup applications.
Fill out the form:
    Name: i3 (or whatever you want to call i3)
    Description: Tiling Window Manager (or whatever you want)
    Command: i3 (must be "i3", as below)

### Remove non-i3 Keyboard Shortcuts

Open the 'Keyboard' dialogue.
Go to the 'Application Shortcuts' tab as above.
Remove all keyboard shortcuts

### Logout/login and enjoy
